## Starting the application

In the root project directory, run the following command:
`npm start`

The frontend React application itself will be available at: `https://localhost:3000`

And the backend will be available at `https://localhost:4000`

## Starting the backend separately

To start just the backend, run `npm run start-server` from the root directory, or `cd server` and then run `npm start`

## Starting the frontend separately

To start just the frontend, run `npm run start-client` from the root directory, or `cd client` and then run `npm start`
