### Q: What is the importance of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engelâ€™s ideas in urban sociology? Please, explain.

Karl Marx was a real pioneer in European urban sociology. He was one of the first classical sociologists to examine the impact industrialization had on the economic climate of European countries, which he argued also extended and affected social, cultural, and political norms. Marx believed that the capitalist system was failing the working-class _proletariats_ - those who did not control means of production - and was unfairly rewarding the _bourgeoisie_ - those who did. This created social conflict and tension between the two groups. Marx's colleague Fredrich Engels - who held similar capitalist ideals - acknowledged the fact that urban life in particular was special in that it gave rise to political systems and forms of governence and specialization within the economy. However, they purported, the system was open to exploitation - and those who were exploited wound up worse off than the ones who were exploiting.

Today, Marx and Engel's theory of urban sociology remains relevant, and perhaps has become even more relevant now with the dawn of billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. While inflation continues to rise and affect consumers, business owners continue to hike their prices to keep their margins unrealistically high. Meanwhile, minimum wage workers who provide most of the real value for the company struggle to get by and see almost none of the actual profits reflected in their hourly wages. I think Marx's claim that the social climate is determined largely by the economic situation is a strong one: as poletaraiat working-class people feel the affects of the COVID-19 supply chain crisis reflected in the prices at the grocery store, gas pump, and more, they continue to feel more and more resentment towards those who are ultimately unaffected by these changes. They also feel more strongly about the political situation: voter turnout went up significantly following the 2008 financial crisis.

### Q: Why are cities where they are? Please, explain.

Though cities can develop essentially wherever a large population congregates to trade and live with one another, there are some geographical trends that the location of cities tend to follow. For one, economic opportunity has to be (or at least, once was) optimal in the region. This usually means either being near an abundance of natural resources like a mine or a forest, or being near a key trading location like a port, railroad, or major highway. Secondly, the environmental factors at play must be tolerable: not many cities develop in areas with extreme weather conditions like the Arctic tundra or the barren deserts. It's also uncommon to see cities developed in regions with dangerously high water tables, which can cause frequent floods and damage to infrastructure. Lastly, historical and social aspects can attract cities: it's common for cities to develop around learning institutions like universities, and even more common for them to develop around religiously significant areas like Jerusalem for the Abrahamic religions.

Though cities tend to be located in areas with access to a waterway, either along the coast to an ocean or sea, or somewhere along a major river, we do see landlocked cities as well. A great example of this is Vatican City, which has great religious significance to followers of Christianity. It developed despite its poor geography because people were drawn to the social and cultural influences in the area. Another great example of this is Las Vegas. It was able to grow thanks to advances in modern technology like air conditioning and
