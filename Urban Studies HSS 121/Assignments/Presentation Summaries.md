### Dubai

Dubai is a city with no taxes whatsoever, and shockingly, still amazing infrastructure and high earning residents. The culture is largely influenced by modern technology and lavish lifestyles. Islam is the prominent religion there.

### Toronto

Toronto, like its European counterpart cities, has a lot of issues with class segregation which breeds crime and unrest in certain areas. It is the most culturally diverse city in the world, thanks to its open immigration policy. Like New York, it has lots of high rises and a large financial/business district, and the great white-collar jobs have lead to suburbs and residential neighborhoods popping up.

### Paris

Paris is France's center for trade and commerce, with a strong focus on the fashion and tourism industry. This creates a culture that highly values artistic expression and clothing options.

### St. Louis

Originally a fur trading outpost, it became a key gathering point for people headed west during the expansion to the west in the Manifest Destiny area. Cultural elements like the world's fair, zoos, and museums have created a fun social life and tourist industry to the area. Car manufacturing is the major indsutry there, which defines most of the business district which houses many factories.

### New Orleans

New Orleans was founded by French settlers in the 1600s. Since then, it was bought by America in the Louisiana Purchase, and it has become a cultural hub. The food there is a sort of French-fusion and cafes are common. Music is a big scene there, it's the birthplace of Blues, Jazz, and it's where Louis Armstrong hails from.

### Arlington

Home to many defense-related companies, the industry is booming with tech and public-sector work. Given its proximity to Washington DC a lot of government-sector working class people live in Arlington and commute to DC each day. It's cheaper to live in than DC.

### Washington DC (Matthew)

DC was not the first US capital, and it was established in 1790. It receives more rainfall anually than Seattle, WA! The whole city is planned and built around the Capitol Building. The politicians and most who work in D.C. leave the city once their workday is over and live in suburbs or edge cities.

### NYC (Chris)

Chris talked mostly about the educational system in New York and how they compare to the European education system. He mentions how European countries have fewer private schools and a more nationalized curriculum, encouraging equal access to the same level of schooling to everyone. In New York, schools are managed and funded by state and local governments, leading to great discrepencies in the level of schooling between neighborhoods and boroughs. Charter Schools are admission-only privately-funded schools that students must be able to test into, and generally have a much higher level of individual care for each student.

### Seattle (Ryan)

Seattle's early growth can be attributed to its timber and fishing industries, and later to its seaports and manufacturing capabilites. Seattle is focused on growing vertically rather than sprawling and taking up more land, and they have a comprehensive plan in place to manage the booming population density. From the American perspective, the growing wealth gap is attributed to the moving of offices of big tech companies like Google and Amazon to the area. From the European perspective, they have focused on incorporating natural areas, waterways, and parks into the city to provide a better quality of life for residents.

### Loveland

Loveland was founded in the late 19th century and was built in the valley of the Thompson River which gave it railway access to Denver. Early on, it was mostly an agriculture community. Later on, the manufacturing companies moved in and new industries popped up like recreational marijuanna, which has lead to huge economic growth. Because of this growth, the city is changing its geography rapidly, leading to confusing transport systems and changing travel routes. However, the rising cost of water is becoming a restriction.

## Tokyo

Tokyo is divided into "wards" or boroughs like New York, except it has 23 of them. Despite its size, the rent is still high and the square footage is still low, also like New York - probably due to the fact that 30% of all of Japan's population lives in this megopolis alone. The city is very clean because of strict waste management rules for residents. Their public transport system is very good because of how hard it is to drive a car there.

## Nashville (me)

## Miami (Owen)

Miami is very diverse, but unfortunately suffers from severe economic inequality that coincides with racial segregation. Miami is 70% hispanic, mostly Cuban, but they tend to live in the West, further from the water, as that prime real estate tends to belong to the 13% white population. Within Miami is an area called Liberty City, with the highest crime rate of all of the neighborhoods. Politically, Miami prides itself on its low income tax, lax COVID restrictions, and social conservatism.

## San Francisco

San Francisco experienced its initial growth during the California Gold Rush. Socially, San Francisco is very liberal and open community. The most iconic spots in San Francisco include the Golden Gate Bridge and Pier 39. San Francisco is very hilly, and the public transport requires powered railing to be able to get up and down the inclines.

## Washington DC (Caden)

The architect Pierre L'Enfant was commissioned by Washington to draft a grid system for the city's infrastructure. His plan was heavily influenced by European cities, and Washington DC is now arguably the most European-style city in the US. Although his plans were not fully realized - the concentric rings were not implemented, the plan worked well. The city is consistent throughout, also thanks to its 13 story height limit. Their Metro system, built in the 1970s, keeps the roads small and not too congested.

## Barcelona

Barcelona is the capitol of Catalonia, a region within Spain. It is the 3rd largest port in Spain, and the 9th largest in all of Europe. Barcelona is built in an octogonal grid system, which helps alleviate traffic in the very narrow streets. Barcelona has a major rivalry with Real Madrid, mostly in soccer now, but it began when Catalonia tried to declare independence from Spain.

## San Juan amd Aguada, Puerto Rico

San Juan is mostly a tourist center, and the economy and landscape is largely built around this. Guided tours, rum tastings, and snorkeling, are activites tourists partake in. Aguada is more nature-based, with free access to beaches, forests, and coves that attract fewer people despite being free.

## Charleston

Charleston is focused on developing the area and incorporating nature. They want to be walkable, with mixed use centers and parks. There is a mixture of people there: retirees, military personell, and
