### Dubai

Dubai is a city with no taxes whatsoever, and shockingly, still amazing infrastructure and high earning residents. The culture is largely influenced by modern technology and lavish lifestyles. Islam is the prominent religion there.

### Toronto

Toronto, like its European counterpart cities, has a lot of issues with class segregation which breeds crime and unrest in certain areas. It is the most culturally diverse city in the world, thanks to its open immigration policy. Like New York, it has lots of high rises and a large financial/business district, and the great white-collar jobs have lead to suburbs and residential neighborhoods popping up.

### Paris

Paris is France's center for trade and commerce, with a strong focus on the fashion and tourism industry. This creates a culture that highly values artistic expression and clothing options.

### St. Louis

Originally a fur trading outpost, it became a key gathering point for people headed west during the expansion to the west in the Manifest Destiny area. Cultural elements like the world's fair, zoos, and museums have created a fun social life and tourist industry to the area. Car manufacturing is the major indsutry there, which defines most of the business district which houses many factories.

### New Orleans

New Orleans was founded by French settlers in the 1600s. Since then, it was bought by America in the Louisiana Purchase, and it has become a cultural hub. The food there is a sort of French-fusion and cafes are common. Music is a big scene there, it's the birthplace of Blues, Jazz, and it's where Louis Armstrong hails from.

### Arlington

Home to many defense-related companies, the industry is booming with tech and public-sector work. Given its proximity to Washington DC a lot of government-sector working class people live in Arlington and commute to DC each day. It's cheaper to live in than DC.

### Washington DC (Matthew)

DC was not the first US capital, and it was established in 1790. It receives more rainfall anually than Seattle, WA! The whole city is planned and built around the Capitol Building. The politicians and most who work in D.C. leave the city once their workday is over and live in suburbs or edge cities.

### NYC (Chris)

Chris talked mostly about the educational system in New York and how they compare to the European education system. He mentions how European countries have fewer private schools and a more nationalized curriculum, encouraging equal access to the same level of schooling to everyone. In New York, schools are managed and funded by state and local governments, leading to great discrepencies in the level of schooling between neighborhoods and boroughs. Charter Schools are admission-only privately-funded schools that students must be able to test into, and generally have a much higher level of individual care for each student.

### Seattle (Ryan)

Seattle's early growth can be attributed to its timber and fishing industries, and later to its seaports and manufacturing capabilites. Seattle is focused on growing vertically rather than sprawling and taking up more land, and they have a comprehensive plan in place to manage the booming population density. From the American perspective, the growing wealth gap is attributed to the moving of offices of big tech companies like Google and Amazon to the area. From the European perspective, they have focused on incorporating natural areas, waterways, and parks into the city to provide a better quality of life for residents.

### Loveland, CO

Loveland was founded in the late 19th century and was built in the valley of the Thompson River which gave it railway access to Denver. Early on, it was mostly an agriculture community. Later on, the manufacturing companies moved in and new industries popped up like recreational marijuanna, which has lead to huge economic growth. Because of this growth, the city is changing its geography rapidly, leading to confusing transport systems and changing travel routes. However, the rising cost of water is becoming a restriction.
